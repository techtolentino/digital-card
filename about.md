### Former life

Seems just like yesterday. I was a Site Supervisor for a local YMCA in San Diego, California, working directly in an elementary school. With the responsibility of running the school's before-and-after school program, I was fortunate to have had a significant impact on many young students within the surrounding learning community. I worked with thousands of kids, collectively, and I loved being in the position of being able to inspire these students to value their education.

One problem though.

For my family, the position itself was not sustainable. Imagine being a father, a so-called _provider_ for your family, and bringing home a humbling $700 check, every couple of weeks.

It used to hurt - carrying my son in my arms and looking into his eyes and thinking to myself:

_"I have no idea how I'm going to do this, but I promise you, we're going to give you the best life you could possibly have."_

The guilt and fear of not being a 'suitable father' led me back to school (while still working full-time). Somehow I was able to accelerate through another undergrad program and receive a Bachelor's of Science in Information Technology in a couple of years. But even then, I didn't know where I would find a decent enough job, espcially since San Diego isn't known for being too much of a tech city.

By the time our second son was born, I was sure of a few things:

1. I knew I wanted a role in the tech industry
2. This would mean learning a totally new skillset
3. We would have to leave San Diego

### Uprooting

Leaving your family and friends behind is something I would've never dreamed of doing. The same goes for my wife. Plus, everything and everyone that our boys knew was _in_ San Diego.
